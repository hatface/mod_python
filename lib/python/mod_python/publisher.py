  This handler is conceptually similar to Zope's ZPublisher, except
  that it:

  1. Is written specifically for mod_python and is therefore much faster
  2. Does not require objects to have a documentation string
  3. Passes all arguments as simply string
  4. Does not try to match Python errors to HTTP errors
  5. Does not give special meaning to '.' and '..'.
